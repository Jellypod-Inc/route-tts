# Changelog

## 0.29.0

- Classify ElevenLabs Terms-of-Service blocks as `SpeechSdkProviderError` with canonical `code: "content_policy"` and `retryable: false`, while preserving the original provider payload in `details` and leaving unrelated 403 responses unchanged. App callers should map `content_policy` to content-refusal UX (for example, `content_refused` with guidance to edit wording or switch hosts) instead of matching message strings.
- **Breaking: the Speechbase gateway is removed.** Speechbase is deprecated, so a `"provider/model"` string now resolves straight to that provider's own implementation instead of proxying through `api.speechbase.ai`. `resolveModel("openai/tts-1")` is equivalent to `createOpenAI()("tts-1")`, so string and factory models take the same code path, use the same per-provider env var (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, …), and get the same client-side behavior: auto-chunking, volume normalization, output conversion, local time-stretching for `speed`, pronunciation substitution, and timestamp alignment. A bare provider id (`"openai"`) uses that provider's default model; an unrecognized prefix throws before any request is made, listing the supported prefixes.
- **Removed:** `createSpeechGateway`, `SpeechGatewayProvider`, `SpeechGatewayProviderConfig`, `GatewayInputError`, and `MixedDispatchError`. The `SPEECHBASE_API_KEY` and `SPEECH_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variables are no longer read. Callers passing string models must have the relevant provider's own key available; callers who imported `createSpeechGateway` for a custom proxy URL should use the target provider's factory with a `baseURL` instead.
- **Conversations lose the gateway dispatch path.** `generateConversation` now chooses between native dialogue and local stitch only. Mixing providers across turns is no longer an error class of its own — heterogeneous turns simply render via stitch.
- The `apiKey` option on `generateSpeech` / `streamSpeech` / `generateConversation` now supplies the resolved provider's key rather than a gateway key. It is still ignored when `model` is a `ResolvedModel` from a factory.
- **`SpeechSdkProviderError.stage` is no longer read off a provider's error body.** The `stage` field was part of the gateway's problem+json envelope; upstream provider APIs never return it, and every direct call site already sets `stage` itself, which took precedence. The field is still populated as before on synthesis and alignment errors.

## 0.28.0

- **Fix: short Google Gemini TTS lines are no longer blocked as `PROHIBITED_CONTENT`.** The provider fused its directive and the transcript into one string (`Read aloud: Slowly.`), which for a short line parses as delivery guidance with nothing attached to voice. Google documents the consequence: a prompt too vague to trigger the speech synthesis classifier is rejected as `PROHIBITED_CONTENT`, deterministically and unrecoverably by retry. Measured against `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`, seven of ten adverbs of manner (`Slowly.`, `Quietly.`, `Softly.`, `Loudly.`, `Firmly.`, `Calmly.`, `Warmly.`) blocked under the old shape — exactly the vocabulary of one-word reaction turns — and ten of a 35-line sample blocked overall. The prompt now names the operation, labels the transcript boundary, guards against the notes being voiced, and puts the transcript on its own line, so a one-word line is content rather than a modifier; the same sample blocks zero lines. Applied to both the single-shot `generateContent` path and the `/interactions` streaming path. Caller `instructions` move under a `Delivery:` label above the transcript instead of being prepended bare. The conservative per-model input budget shrinks to reserve room for the longer framing, so very long input may split into one more chunk than before.
- **A terse input blocked as `PROHIBITED_CONTENT` now gets its reshaped retry.** The reshaped-payload retry was skipped for any `promptFeedback.blockReason` on the premise that a content refusal cannot be lifted by a differently shaped payload. That premise holds for `SAFETY`, `BLOCKLIST`, and `SPII`, but `PROHIBITED_CONTENT` on a TTS model is the code Google attributes to a prompt too vague to classify — which is precisely what reshaping fixes. Terse input carrying that reason now gets its one quoted retry; the genuine refusal reasons remain non-retryable. With the reframing above this should rarely fire.

## 0.27.0

- **Fix: a terse Gemini TTS input that comes back without audio is retried once with a reshaped payload.** Gemini TTS is `generateContent`, so a payload short enough to read as a bare chat turn can come back answered rather than voiced, and the identical retry the SDK already performs cannot change that. Input of 24 characters or fewer now gets one additional attempt with the text quoted and terminally punctuated (`Read aloud: "Yes."`) before the segment is failed. The reshape only ever runs after a response already came back without audio, so the success path is byte-identical to before; longer input, input already containing a quote, a response carrying a content refusal (`SAFETY`, a `promptFeedback.blockReason`), and the multi-speaker dialogue path are all skipped. Existing terminal punctuation is preserved across every language the model declares, not just Latin. When the reshaped attempt also comes back empty, the error reports the diagnostics from both attempts. A persistent terse failure therefore issues up to two provider requests per outer retry rather than one.
- **A 200 response carrying no audio now reports why.** Both provider sites that detect a parsed-but-empty synthesis response previously discarded the only evidence of why the provider declined. Google's `generateContent` response schema now also parses `finishReason`, part `text`, and top-level `promptFeedback.blockReason`, and the error names whichever came back, including a truncated sample of any text the model answered with instead of voicing (the single-shot and multi-speaker dialogue paths both report it). ElevenLabs' `/with-timestamps` missing-`audio_base64` error now names the `request-id` response header and whether `alignment` and `normalized_alignment` came back, separating "the model generated nothing" from "the audio was dropped on the way out".
- **Every "200 response carrying no audio" site now throws `NoSpeechGeneratedError`**, so callers can distinguish a provider declining from a transport failure by error class. Previously these threw a bare `Error` (Google single-shot, Inworld) or `SpeechSDKError` (Google dialogue, ElevenLabs, Hume, MiniMax, Speechify). Hume, MiniMax, Inworld, and Speechify keep their existing messages; only the class changed. Callers matching `instanceof SpeechSDKError` are unaffected, since `NoSpeechGeneratedError` extends it — callers matching `Error` on Google single-shot or Inworld are likewise unaffected.
- **The six argument-less `NoSpeechGeneratedError` throws now name their model.** They previously surfaced only the class default, "No speech audio was generated.", naming neither provider nor model. The two fan-out sites (chunked synthesis, native-split dialogue blocks) additionally name which chunk or block was empty, since one silent piece fails the whole stitch and the survivors are otherwise indistinguishable.

Apart from the terse-input reshape above, which runs only after a response already came back without audio, these are diagnostics: the success path issues the same requests it always did. Callers matching on error message text will need to update their patterns.

## 0.26.0

- **Breaking: on direct-provider paths, word timestamps never fail synthesis.** Empty, invalid, or mismatched timings no longer throw `TimestampValidationError` and no longer discard correctly synthesized audio. When native timestamps and alignment both fail — or the input is below a few words, where forced alignment cannot succeed and is skipped — the SDK distributes the words evenly across the measured audio duration (a single span for one word). Callers that relied on the throw should check the new `metadata.timestampsSource` field (`'native' | 'aligned' | 'estimated'`) instead. Gateway-routed requests are unchanged: the gateway server owns its timestamp contract, so its failures still surface as `TimestampValidationError`.
- **Chunked forced alignment.** When long input is split by `maxInputChars` and stitched, forced alignment now runs once per synthesis chunk against that chunk's own audio and text, concatenated with the stitch offsets the SDK already computes — instead of a single unbounded call over the stitched result that exceeds aligner input limits.
- Native timestamp validation failures on direct paths now fall back to the factory-level `fallbackSTT` when no `timestampProvider` is configured, matching the existing `timestampProvider` recovery behavior.

## 0.25.3

- **Fix: long Google Gemini TTS input now chunks automatically instead of reaching Google as one oversized request.** Gemini 3.1 Flash TTS Preview, Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS Preview, and Gemini 2.5 Pro TTS Preview now declare conservative provider-owned input limits below their documented 8,192-token ceiling. The effective spoken-text budget also reserves space for the SDK's read-aloud directive and caller instructions. Direct-provider requests split on sentence/word boundaries, synthesize in parallel, stitch in source order, convert to the requested format, and run timestamp alignment once on the final audio with the complete transcript. Google 400 responses remain non-retryable; gateway routing remains server-owned.

## 0.25.2

- Fix pronunciation timestamp projection for arbitrary source and replacement token counts. The projector now preserves exact matching prefix and suffix boundaries, maps equal changed spans one to one, merges multiple replacement words into one caller word, and interpolates only caller boundaries that have no provider evidence. Interpolated results include a warning instead of failing valid generated audio with `transcript_mismatch`.

## 0.25.1

- Fix pronunciation timestamp projection for multi-word source phrases when the replacement alignment contains the same number of provider words, and preserve unchanged text when a provider token crosses a pronunciation edit boundary (for example, `S-A-F’s` back to `SAF’s`). The SDK now restores caller word boundaries from exact provider timings instead of rejecting valid audio with `transcript_mismatch`; alignments that cannot map one-to-one remain rejected.

## 0.25.0

- **Breaking: one unusable pronunciation rule no longer fails the whole request.** `pronunciations.rules` entries whose `word` or `replacement` is empty after trimming are now skipped instead of throwing `SpeechSDKError`; the remaining rules still apply. Skipping is silent — callers that relied on the throw to detect malformed rule sets need to validate their own rule sets before passing them in.
- **Fix: whitespace-padded pronunciation rules no longer corrupt substituted text.** `word` and `replacement` are trimmed at the ends before matching, so a rule stored as `'hello ' -> 'HELLO'` applies exactly like `'hello' -> 'HELLO'` rather than consuming the following space and fusing tokens (`"hello world"` → `"HELLOworld"`), which broke forced alignment with a non-retryable `transcript_mismatch`. Internal whitespace is untouched, so multi-word rules such as `'New York' -> 'noo YORK'` are unchanged. `" "` and `""` are now treated identically; neither reaches the matcher.

## 0.24.3

- Fix ElevenLabs Forced Alignment responses that group multiple transcript words into one `words` entry. The adapter now reconstructs exact word boundaries from ElevenLabs character timings, selects that result only when it covers the supplied transcript, and retains the word response as a compatibility fallback. Valid generated audio no longer fails with `transcript_mismatch` because of provider token grouping.

## 0.24.2

- **Fix: ElevenLabs text normalization no longer causes valid native timestamps to fail with `transcript_mismatch`.** The adapter selects the original-text alignment when normalized text expands numbers or abbreviations and retains normalized alignment when it is the candidate that exactly covers canonical text (for example, after Eleven v3 audio-tag removal). For direct models, an explicitly configured `timestampProvider` now runs as a fallback when native timestamp validation fails; valid native timestamps still avoid the extra alignment request, and gateway responses remain untouched.

## 0.24.1

- Fix ElevenLabs forced alignment responses that include spacing or punctuation-only entries in `words`. The adapter now returns lexical word timestamps only, allowing exact transcript validation to preserve caller whitespace and punctuation without rejecting every multiword transcript.

## 0.24.0

- Add `instructions` as optional, non-spoken delivery direction on `generateSpeech`, `streamSpeech`, and conversations. `text` remains the exact canonical spoken transcript. Supporting models declare the new `instructions` feature; direct unsupported models throw `InstructionsUnsupportedError` before synthesis, while gateway requests preserve the separate wire fields for server-side capability validation. Google Gemini TTS and OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini-tts` support the new field.
- Exact timestamp alignment now receives and validates only canonical spoken text after deterministic audio-cue removal and pronunciation substitution. Provider request framing, delivery instructions, supported audio tags, and native-dialogue speaker formatting are excluded. Native, custom `timestampProvider`, legacy STT fallback, gateway, stitched conversation, and native-dialogue paths all retain exact lexical coverage validation.
- **Fix: ElevenLabs text normalization no longer causes valid native timestamps to fail with `transcript_mismatch`.** The adapter selects the original-text alignment when normalized text expands numbers or abbreviations and retains normalized alignment when it is the candidate that exactly covers canonical text (for example, after Eleven v3 audio-tag removal). For direct models, an explicitly configured `timestampProvider` now runs as a fallback when native timestamp validation fails; valid native timestamps still avoid the extra alignment request, and gateway responses remain untouched.

## 0.23.0

- **Word timestamps now project exactly onto the text synthesized by the SDK.** Native, gateway, and explicitly derived candidates are accepted only when they completely cover the processed input's Unicode lexical content in order, contain no extra lexical content or punctuation-only entries, and have finite, nonnegative, monotonic timings within the generated audio. Public `WordTimestamp.text` values come from caller input after unsupported audio-tag removal; pronunciation substitutions are aligned against synthesized text and mapped back before return. Invalid requested timestamps throw `TimestampValidationError` instead of returning incorrect or fabricated alignment.
- Add the `TimestampProvider` interface and `timestampProvider` option for direct models without native timestamps. `timestamps: true` remains the single switch for requesting timestamps; the provider is ignored for native and gateway models. `createElevenLabs().forcedAlignment()` supplies a provider that posts generated audio and exact synthesized text to `/v1/forced-alignment`. There is no implicit OpenAI fallback; legacy explicit `fallbackSTT` configuration remains supported.
- **Fix: ElevenLabs character alignment no longer emits punctuation-only word timestamps.** Standalone punctuation (including dashes, ellipses, quotes, commas, periods, and apostrophes) attaches deterministically to an adjacent lexical word while preserving caller spacing and the combined timing span; punctuation-only input yields no word timestamps.

## 0.22.0

- Add the exported, serializable `SpeechSdkProviderError` for provider non-2xx responses. It exposes `status`, `provider`, `model`, canonical `code`, the complete parsed provider body in `details`, unmodified response text in `rawResponse`, `requestId`, `retryable`, and optional `stage` (`synthesis` or `alignment`). `toJSON()` retains these fields for structured/serverless logging. The error extends `ApiError`, preserving `instanceof ApiError`, `statusCode`, `responseBody`, current summarized messages, retry timing, and turn attribution.
- **Google Gemini TTS `INVALID_ARGUMENT` responses now retain their complete `google.rpc.Status`.** Callers can inspect `BadRequest.fieldViolations`, `ErrorInfo.reason`, and metadata instead of receiving only `API error 400: Request contains an invalid argument.` The same structured error representation applies across direct providers and Speech Gateway responses; raw bodies are never truncated.

## 0.21.0

- Add the **Speechify** TTS provider (`speechify` prefix, `createSpeechify()` factory, `SPEECHIFY_API_KEY`). Ships three streaming models — `simba-english` (default, English), `simba-multilingual` (25 languages), and `simba-3.0` (English) — synthesizing at a fixed 48 kHz. `voice` is required and must be a Speechify `voice_id`. `generateSpeech` uses the `/audio/speech` JSON envelope (base64) and `streamSpeech` uses the raw-bytes `/audio/stream` route; `wav` and `mp3` are produced natively (`wav` is unavailable on the stream route, which defaults to `mp3`), and `pcm` is produced by decoding wav locally. Exposed via the `@speech-sdk/core/providers` subpath (`createSpeechify`).
- **Conversations with more unique voices than a native-dialogue provider supports now render via per-turn stitch instead of failing.** When a `generateConversation` request has more distinct voices than the provider's native multi-speaker limit (e.g. 3 voices on Google's `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`, which supports exactly 2), the SDK now renders each turn as its own single-voice `generateSpeech` call and stitches them into one clip (honoring `gapMs` / `volumeDbfs` / `speed` / `output` / timestamps), with a warning that native multi-speaker dialogue was bypassed. Previously this threw `DialogueConstraintError`, which surfaced as a gateway 500. This supersedes the 0.19.0 behavior where the over-`maxVoices` case still threw — the fallback is now warned rather than silent. `DialogueConstraintError` remains exported but is no longer thrown by the conversation router. The two-or-fewer-distinct-voice native path and the gateway path are unchanged.
- **Fix: single-turn Gemini TTS rejected terse/conversational input with a 400.** Gemini's `generateContent` endpoint reads a bare short turn (e.g. "Hello there.") as a chat prompt and tries to *answer* it, which a TTS-only model rejects with `400 "Model tried to generate text, but it should only be used for TTS."`. `generateSpeech` / `streamSpeech` on the Google provider now frame the single-turn request as a read-aloud directive so Gemini voices the text verbatim instead of answering it — the documented Gemini TTS style-prompt form, where the instruction before the colon is delivery guidance and isn't spoken, so `text`, timestamps, and char-count/billing are unchanged. Longer inputs, the multi-speaker path, and the 3.1 `/interactions` streaming path are unchanged.

## 0.20.0

- Add **multi-provider voice design** via a new top-level `designVoice()` function. Pass a `provider` factory (e.g. `createElevenLabs()`), a `name`, and a natural-language `description` (plus optional `previewText`, `language`, `providerOptions`), and the SDK creates a brand-new synthetic voice on the provider, returning `{ voiceId, provider, preview?, warnings?, providerMetadata? }`. The returned `voiceId` is passed straight back as `voice` to `generateSpeech()`, and `preview` (`{ audio, mediaType }`) is a short sample of the designed voice. Design is provider-level — no model id is needed, and the voice works across all of that provider's models. Supported on seven providers — ElevenLabs, MiniMax, Fal, Hume, Inworld, Resemble, and Fish Audio — each marked with the `voice-design` capability (`FEATURES.VOICE_DESIGN`).
- The SDK absorbs each provider's underlying flow so callers always get one reusable id: single-call (MiniMax, Fal), design→persist (ElevenLabs, Hume, Inworld, Resemble), and design→clone (Fish Audio, whose `/v1/voice-design` is stateless — the SDK persists the candidate through Fish's clone endpoint).
- **Hume** custom voices are referenced by name under the `CUSTOM_VOICE` namespace. `generate()` gains a `providerOptions.voiceProvider` override (default `HUME_AI`) so designed/custom voices are usable; `designVoice()` returns a `warnings` entry reminding you to set it.
- **Resemble** voice design uses the public REST API (`app.resemble.ai/api/v2`), separate from its synthesis cluster — added an `appBaseURL` config option (`createResemble({ appBaseURL })`).
- Adds `VoiceDesignUnsupportedError` (thrown for providers without design support) and `InvalidDesignFieldError`. Design through the gateway provider is not supported.
- **Fix: Smallest AI clone and TTS endpoints were retired and returned `410 Gone`.** smallest.ai migrated off the `lightning-large` namespace, so both routes the provider used were dead: `cloneVoice()` posted to `https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning-large/add_voice` and `generateSpeech()` posted to `https://api.smallest.ai/waves/v1/tts`, each returning `410 This model is retired. Please migrate to lightning-v3.1`. The provider now targets the live routes — TTS at `https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning-v3.1/get_speech` (both `lightning_v3.1` and `lightning_v3.1_pro` are served here, with the variant selected by the `model` body field) and cloning at the model-agnostic `https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/voice-cloning` (multipart `displayName` + `file`, voice id read from `data.voiceId`). Clone and TTS now share one host, so a custom `baseURL` routes both. `get_speech` always responds with `Content-Type: audio/wav` even for `mp3`/`pcm`, so the SDK now derives the returned media type from the requested `output_format` instead of trusting the header. The default voice fallbacks (`magnus` for `lightning_v3.1`, `meher` for `lightning_v3.1_pro`) remain valid. Verified end-to-end against the live API: clone-then-generate returns `200` and produces playable WAV.

## 0.19.0

- **Single-speaker conversations no longer attempt native multi-speaker dialogue.** When every turn of a `generateConversation` request resolves to the same voice, the conversation is just sequential single-speaker speech — the SDK now renders it per-turn via `generateSpeech` and stitches the turns into one clip (respecting `gapMs` / `volumeDbfs` / `speed` / `output`) instead of routing into a provider's native dialogue path. Previously, native-dialogue providers that require multiple distinct voices (e.g. Google's `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`, which requires exactly 2) threw `DialogueConstraintError` for a single-voice conversation, surfacing as a gateway 500. The two-or-more distinct-voice case is unchanged and still uses the native path; a conversation with **more** unique voices than a provider supports still throws `DialogueConstraintError` (no silent wrong-path fallback). Timestamps are honored on both paths. The gateway path is unchanged — the gateway server owns its own routing.
- **Breaking (provider authors): `dialogueCapabilities()` no longer returns `minVoices`.** Native dialogue is now universally defined as requiring 2+ distinct voices — a single voice is always sequential single-speaker speech routed to stitch — so the per-provider minimum is redundant. Providers declare only `{ maxVoices, maxTotalChars? }`. This affects only custom providers that implement `SpeechProvider.dialogueCapabilities`; all built-in providers are updated. No change for callers of `generateSpeech` / `generateConversation`.

## 0.18.2

- **Lower Gemini's native dialogue per-call budget from `5000` to `2500` characters.** Gemini TTS generation latency climbs with output length, so the previous budget produced slow first-audio on long conversations. Halving `dialogueCapabilities().maxTotalChars` for Google's Gemini TTS models means longer conversations are partitioned into more, shorter native-dialogue blocks that render in parallel and stitch together — faster than fewer long calls, with the same native multi-speaker sound. No API change; the gateway path is unchanged.

## 0.18.1

- **Long native dialogue is now rendered in parallel native-dialogue blocks instead of failing.** Native multi-speaker providers cap how much text one call can render (e.g. Gemini TTS shares a 32k-token window between input and generated audio). When a `generateConversation` request exceeds the provider's per-call limit, the SDK now keeps the native rendering: it partitions the turns into blocks at turn boundaries — each block under the limit and still satisfying the provider's unique-voice rule — renders each block as its own native-dialogue call **in parallel** (bounded by `maxConcurrency`), then RMS-normalizes and stitches the blocks into one file (`gapMs` applies at block seams only). Word timestamps are composed across blocks with `turnIndex` remapped to the global turn list. This improves latency for long conversations while preserving the native multi-speaker sound. The per-call budget is owned by each provider via `dialogueCapabilities().maxTotalChars`; Google's Gemini TTS models now declare one (`5000`). If a conversation can't be split into voice-valid blocks (a single turn longer than the limit, or a long single-speaker run on a two-voice model), it falls back to the local-stitch path with a warning. The gateway path is unchanged — the gateway server owns its own chunking.

## 0.18.0

- Add **instant voice cloning** via a new top-level `cloneVoice()` function. Pass a `provider` factory (e.g. `createElevenLabs()`), a `name`, and one or more audio `files` (raw `Uint8Array`, `{ audio, mediaType }`, or `{ url }`), and the SDK creates a reusable voice on the provider, returning `{ voiceId, provider, warnings?, providerMetadata? }`. The returned `voiceId` is passed straight back as `voice` to `generateSpeech()`. Cloning is provider-level — no model id is needed, and the voice works across all of that provider's models. Supported on nine providers — ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Fish Audio, Inworld, Mistral, xAI, Gradium, Smallest AI, and MiniMax — each marked with the `voice-cloning` capability on every model.
- **Breaking: removed inline voice cloning.** The `voice` field is now `string` only (a voice id) — `Voice` was `string | { url } | { audio }`. Only Mistral and fal ever honored the inline `{ audio }` / `{ url }` form; the other ~14 providers silently coerced the object into a string id and failed at runtime, so the type promised a feature that didn't exist. All voice cloning now goes through `cloneVoice()`, which returns a reusable `voiceId`. The `"inline-voice-cloning"` capability flag (`FEATURES.INLINE_VOICE_CLONING`) is removed accordingly.
- **Fix: ElevenLabs voice cloning targeted the wrong endpoint.** The instant-voice-clone request posted to `/voices/add` (missing the `/v1` prefix every other ElevenLabs endpoint uses), returning `404` against the live API. Now posts to `/v1/voices/add`.
- **Fix: MiniMax voice cloning sent `file_id` as a string.** MiniMax's `/voice_clone` returns the uploaded `file_id` as a JSON integer and rejects a stringified value with `2013 invalid params`. The SDK now echoes the int64 back un-stringified.
- Cloning through the gateway provider (`createSpeechGateway()`) is not supported yet and throws `VoiceCloningUnsupportedError`.

## 0.17.0

- **Real progressive streaming for `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`.** `streamSpeech` on the Google provider now streams audio as it's generated via Gemini's `/interactions` endpoint (`stream: true`), decoding SSE `step.delta` events into raw 16-bit mono PCM at 24 kHz (`audio/pcm;rate=24000`). Previously `stream()` buffered the full clip through `:generateContent` and emitted it as a single chunk. The 2.5 TTS models keep the buffer-and-wrap single-chunk WAV fallback, as they have no progressive streaming endpoint.

## 0.16.0

- Add the **Gradium** TTS provider (`gradium` prefix, `createGradium()` factory, `GRADIUM_API_KEY`). Ships Gradium's `default` model with streaming support across English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese, and up to 20,000 input characters per request. Supports `wav` and `pcm` output natively at 8/16/22.05/24/44.1/48 kHz (default 48 kHz); `mp3` is produced by decoding Gradium's wav/pcm locally. The provider is registered in `aggregatedModels()` so `gradium/default` is discoverable through the gateway path.

## 0.15.1

- **Fix: gateway requests no longer send the legacy top-level `mode` discriminator.** The gateway's strict schemas reject the redundant key now that the server-side compatibility shim was removed, so every inline SDK request was failing with a root-level `400 invalid_input`. The key is dropped from all gateway request bodies, with a wire-shape regression test asserting it never returns.
- **Fix: close `AudioSample` instances in `decodeRawPcm` and `encodePcm16ToMp3`.** mediabunny no longer warns about samples being garbage collected while still open.

## 0.15.0

- **STT timestamp fallback now receives the synthesized source text.** When `generateSpeech` / `generateConversation` derive word timestamps via the STT fallback (a model with no native alignment), the SDK now passes the exact text it rendered as an optional `text` field on `SpeechToTextProvider.transcribe`. A fallback can use it to perform **forced alignment** (align known text → audio) instead of blind transcription. For conversations, `text` is the combined turn text (in turn order) matching the stitched audio; `turnIndex` attribution is unchanged. The field is optional everywhere and fully backward compatible — pure STT providers (the default OpenAI Whisper fallback included) ignore it and behave identically.

## 0.14.0

- **Breaking: removed `moderationRulesetId`.** This option only worked on the Speechbase gateway path and had no meaning for direct providers. The SDK is provider-neutral — nothing in it should require the Speechbase gateway — so it has been dropped along with the `ModerationRulesetIdRequiresGatewayError` it threw on direct-provider models. To override a moderation ruleset per request, call the Speechbase REST API directly.
- **Breaking: removed `pronunciations.dictionaryIds`.** Saved server-side pronunciation dictionaries were a gateway-only feature, so the option and its `DictionaryIdsRequireGatewayError` have been removed for the same provider-neutrality reason. Use the Speechbase REST API directly if you need stored dictionaries.
- **`pronunciations.rules` is unchanged.** Inline pronunciation rules continue to work on every provider — client-side text substitution on direct providers, server-side on the gateway — on `generateSpeech`, `streamSpeech`, and `generateConversation`.

## 0.13.0

- Add the **MiniMax** TTS provider (`minimax` prefix, `createMiniMax()` factory, `MINIMAX_API_KEY`). Ships MiniMax's current flagship T2A v2 models: `speech-2.8-hd` (default) and `speech-2.8-turbo`. The SDK decodes MiniMax's hex-encoded audio envelope, surfaces logical `base_resp` failures as `ApiError` (rate limits retried), and supports `wav` / `pcm` / `mp3` output at 8/16/22.05/24/32/44.1 kHz. `providerOptions` mirror the T2A request body (`voice_setting`, `audio_setting`, `language_boost`, …). Set `groupId` (or `MINIMAX_GROUP_ID`) for endpoints that require a Group ID.

## 0.12.0

- Add Cartesia `sonic-3.5` (`cartesia/sonic-3.5`), Cartesia's latest flagship TTS model. It carries the same capabilities as `sonic-3` — streaming, emotion/audio tags via SSML, inline voice cloning, and native word timestamps — across all 42 supported languages, and is a drop-in replacement for `sonic-3`.
- **Cartesia default model is now `sonic-3.5`** (previously `sonic-3`). Calls that omit the model id (`createCartesia()()` or the bare `"cartesia"` string) now resolve to `sonic-3.5`. Existing voice IDs and prompts work unchanged. Pin `cartesia/sonic-3` explicitly to keep the previous default.

## 0.11.1

- Gateway streaming now targets the dedicated `POST /v1/audio/speech/stream` endpoint instead of the buffered `POST /v1/audio/speech`. `streamSpeech` against the gateway returns true low-latency, chunk-by-chunk audio again; previously it degraded to a single un-chunked response. No public API change; non-streaming models still surface `StreamingNotSupportedError`.
- Gateway key resolution now reads `SPEECHBASE_API_KEY` first and falls back to `SPEECH_GATEWAY_API_KEY` for backward compatibility. An explicit `apiKey` option still wins over both. The missing-key / 401 error messages now reference `SPEECHBASE_API_KEY`.

## 0.11.0

- **Breaking: per-provider default sample rate raised.** Providers that natively support higher rates now default to their highest documented rate instead of 24 kHz: ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Deepgram Aura, Inworld, Murf, Fish Audio (44.1 kHz), and xAI. Stitch and chunk-stitch paths now use `max(per-segment rate)` instead of a 24 kHz constant. Single-rate providers (OpenAI 24 kHz, Google 24 kHz, Hume 48 kHz, Mistral 24 kHz, Resemble 44.1 kHz, Smallest-AI 24 kHz) declare their fixed rate and reject mismatches. Fal remains a pass-through with no rate selection.
  - **ElevenLabs free-tier callers** will see ElevenLabs reject PCM/WAV requests at ≥44.1 kHz. Pass `output: { format: "pcm", sampleRate: 24000 }` to keep the previous behavior.
- **New `output.sampleRate` option** on `AudioOutput`. Pass a positive integer to request a specific rate. Providers throw `UnsupportedSampleRateError` if the rate isn't in their documented set.
- **Fix: `volumeDbfs` no longer hard-clips transient consonants.** `normalizeRms` is now peak-aware: it caps the RMS-targeted gain so post-gain peaks stay ≤0.99 × INT16_MAX. If the source can't reach the requested RMS without clipping, the SDK preserves the source's dynamic range instead of distorting transients.
- New `UnsupportedSampleRateError` thrown when the caller requests a `sampleRate` the provider's API doesn't expose.
- **Fix: `output: { format: "mp3", sampleRate }` at 8/11.025/12 kHz no longer crashes the MP3 encoder.** The encoder now accepts the full MPEG-1/2/2.5 rate set; previously a low rate that passed provider validation threw deep in the local MP3-conversion (volume/chunk/conversation-stitch) path.
- **Fix: Fish Audio MP3 now validates `sampleRate` against its documented MP3 set (32 kHz / 44.1 kHz)** and forwards it, instead of silently dropping the requested rate; out-of-set rates throw `UnsupportedSampleRateError` like every other format.
- **Fix: Murf FALCON** declares its streaming-endpoint rate set (adds 16 kHz) separately from GEN2's `/speech/generate` set.
- **Fix: Fal** throws `UnsupportedSampleRateError` when a caller explicitly requests `output.sampleRate` (it has no rate selection) rather than silently returning audio at its native rate.
- **Fix: Resemble now forwards `sample_rate`.** Resemble's `/synthesize` accepts a documented `sample_rate` string enum (8/16/22.05/32/44.1/48 kHz); the SDK previously sent none and let the API pick an undocumented default (~32 kHz), so requested rates were ignored. It now declares the full set and forwards the chosen rate.
- **Fix: Murf FALCON `pcm` output.** FALCON's `generate`/`stream` derived mediaType from the response Content-Type (defaulting to `audio/wav`), mislabeling raw headerless PCM as WAV so it failed to decode. It now derives mediaType from the request like GEN2.
- Stitch and chunk-stitch now throw if no decoded segment carries a positive sample rate, instead of emitting a 0 Hz WAV.

## 0.10.1

- `generateConversation` no longer throws `ConversationInputError` when a turn carries `providerOptions` on a model that dispatches to native dialogue (e.g. `elevenlabs/eleven_v3`, Gemini multi-speaker). Dispatch falls through to the stitch path and surfaces a warning so callers can see they paid for extra API calls instead of one native call.

## 0.10.0

- Add `inworld-tts-2` model to the Inworld provider.

## 0.9.1

- Migrate gateway domain from `api.speechgateway.com` to `api.speechbase.ai`. The 401 / missing-key error messages now point to `https://speechbase.ai/` for signup. Public API names (`SpeechGatewayProvider`, `createSpeechGateway`, `SPEECH_GATEWAY_API_KEY`) are unchanged. Override `baseURL` on `createSpeechGateway` if you were pinning the old hostname explicitly.

## 0.9.0

- **`speed` parameter** on `generateSpeech` and `generateConversation` (range `0.75`–`1.5`). Direct providers time-stretch the audio locally and scale native timestamps and `audioDurationMs` by `1/speed`; the gateway path forwards `speed` in the wire payload so the gateway invariant is preserved.
- Conversation turns accept a per-turn `speed`. Per-turn `speed` forces the stitch path on direct providers; the gateway forwards both top-level and per-turn `speed`.
- New `@speech-sdk/core/plugins` subpath exposing `timeStretch`, a WSOLA-based mono PCM time-stretcher (the engine behind `speed`).
- When `speed` is set without an explicit `output`, the result is encoded as mp3 (matching what most providers return natively) instead of the wav/pcm intermediate the stretcher operates on.
- Avoid a wasted encode/decode round-trip when `speed` is active: the local post-processing step now defers output conversion to the time-stretch step, preserving quality on lossy formats.

## 0.8.3

- Parallel chunked text generation. When the SDK locally chunks text that exceeds a model's `maxInputChars`, chunk requests now fan out concurrently instead of running sequentially.
- New `GenerateSpeechOptions.maxConcurrency` (default `6`) caps the chunk fan-out. Set to `1` to serialize when a provider's account-level concurrency is the bottleneck. Ignored on the gateway path. Validated as a positive integer; throws on `NaN`/non-integer/non-positive values.
- `runStitch` (conversation path) forwards `maxConcurrency` into per-turn `generateSpeech` calls so chunked turns honor the same setting.
- On first chunk failure, in-flight sibling chunks are now aborted instead of running to completion with discarded results.

## 0.8.2

- Automatic text chunking when input exceeds a provider's `maxInputChars`. The SDK splits long text on sentence/word boundaries and concatenates the resulting audio.
- New per-request `moderationRulesetId` on the gateway path, forwarded to `api.speechbase.ai` for per-call moderation policy selection.

## 0.8.1

- Public subpath `./pronunciations` exposing `substitute`, `mergeRules`, `inverseAlign`, `ruleMapKey`, and types `Pronunciation`/`PronunciationsInput`/`Edit`.

## 0.8.0

- **Speech Gateway routing.** Bare `"provider/model"` strings now resolve to a built-in `SpeechGatewayProvider` that proxies requests to `api.speechbase.ai` using `SPEECH_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. Factory-based usage (`createOpenAI()("tts-1")`) continues to call providers directly. The gateway aggregates every built-in provider's models so capability checks work transparently.
- **Smallest AI Lightning TTS provider** added under `@speech-sdk/core/providers/smallest-ai`. (Thanks @harshitajain165 for the first contribution!)
- **Explicit audio output format.** `generateSpeech` and `generateConversation` now accept `output: "wav" | "mp3" | "pcm"`. The SDK requests the format natively from the provider when supported, and falls back to wav/pcm + local conversion via mediabunny otherwise. Compressed audio is never decoded client-side.
- **Pronunciations option** on `generateSpeech`, `streamSpeech`, and `generateConversation` for applying substitution rules to input text before synthesis.
- **Per-turn metadata** is now surfaced on the `generateConversation` stitch path so callers can inspect timing/duration/provider info per dialogue turn.
- **Retry-After aware retries.** 429 responses honor the server's `Retry-After` header with jittered backoff (WAV-83).
- **Timestamp fallback redesign** as part of the gateway routing work.
- CI: prereleases are now published to npm under the `next` dist-tag.

## 0.7.0

- **Word-level timestamps** on `generateSpeech` and `generateConversation`, with native alignment exposed across five providers and a graceful fallback for the rest.
- **`timestampsToCaptions`** helper for converting word-level timestamps into SRT and WebVTT output.
- License changed from MIT to **Apache-2.0**.
- Removed `dia-tts` and `chatterbox` models from the Fal provider; dropped the `inworld-tts` e2e test.

## 0.6.2

- `generateConversation` no longer caps dialogue at 4 voices.
- The native dialogue path now rejects per-turn `providerOptions`, since providers expect a single set of options for the whole multi-speaker request.

## 0.6.1

- All providers now send an `X-User-Agent: jellypod-speech-sdk` header so backends can identify SDK traffic.
- Configurable volume normalization on `generateSpeech` and `generateConversation`.
- Deepgram: `providerOptions` are now serialized into the query string (matching the Deepgram REST contract).
- Removed the `unreal-speech` provider.

## 0.6.0

- **`generateConversation`** — multi-speaker dialogue API. Uses native multi-speaker endpoints when the chosen provider supports them, and falls back to a stitch pipeline that synthesizes turns individually and concatenates the result.
- Refreshed the supported-language list for Gemini TTS.

## 0.5.2

- New **Inworld TTS provider** under `@speech-sdk/core/providers/inworld`. (Thanks @cshape for the first contribution!)
- Inworld provider sends an `X-User-Agent` header identifying the SDK.

## 0.5.1

- Audio-tag support for Google Gemini 3.1 Flash TTS.
- README badges; bundle-size badge removed.

## 0.5.0

- `generateSpeech` and `streamSpeech` now accept an optional `apiKey` argument, overriding the per-provider env var on a per-call basis.
- New **`SpeechMetadata`** on results, including request timing, audio duration, and provider info.
- Dependabot is now configured to group npm updates and ignore major-version bumps.

## 0.4.1

- xAI provider now reports language codes in ISO 639-1 format.
- Security: bumped Vite and enabled automated dependency updates.

## 0.4.0

- New **xAI TTS provider** under `@speech-sdk/core/providers/xai`.

## 0.3.0

- New **`streamSpeech()`** API for streaming audio from providers that support it.
- `ModelInfo` refactored: capabilities are now expressed as a `features` array instead of individual booleans. Capability checks throughout the SDK consume the new shape.

## 0.2.0

- OpenAI provider: bracketed audio tags (e.g. `[whispers]`) in the input text are mapped to `instructions` for `gpt-4o-mini-tts`.

## 0.1.0

- First minor release. API stabilization ahead of the 0.x feature line.

## 0.0.6

- Fix: bind `globalThis.fetch` so the SDK works correctly in browser environments where `fetch` is not bound to the global object.

## 0.0.5

- New `audioTags` field on `ModelInfo` to declare which providers/models support audio tags.
- Audio-tag support for Fish Audio.

## 0.0.4

- Initial **audio tag support** with per-provider processing.
- Audio-tag docs added; Husky removed from the dev toolchain.

## 0.0.3

- Added model metadata and refreshed the supported-language lists for all providers.

## 0.0.1

- Initial release as `@speech-sdk/core`.
